# CompubrasJPA
Compubras is a company from a friend of our professor who let us use a sample database from his products to implement our code.

So for the subject of Database II we needed to develop this JPA & Hibernate project, using this compubras database model.
Without controllers and services but already doing persistence with data.

You can look the tasks asked by the professor in [JPQL Queries](https://github.com/GabeSerafim/compubrasJPA/blob/master/src/model/JPQLQueries.java)
